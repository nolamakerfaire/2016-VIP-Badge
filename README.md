# 2016 VIP Badge
![Rendering](http://nolamakerfaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/rendering.png "VIP Badge")

The 2016 New Orleans Mini Maker Faire VIP Badge features an integrated 3.3v 8Mhz Arduino Pro Mini derivative microcontroller and USB FTDI Programmer. The badges come pre-assembled, and feature breakout headers to access the digital and analog pins as well as ground and voltage. Any 3.3v-compatible components can be used with the badge. Additionally, battery packs will be included, but they badge can also be powered by a standard USB cellphone charging battery. Finally, the Arduino Pro Mini derivative and the USB programmer snap out of the badge so you can easily integrate them into future projects.

The badge can be programmed just like a standard [Arduino Pro Mini](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoProMini). In the Arduino IDE, select Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3V, 8 MHz) w/ ATmega328 from the Tools > Board menu. 

If snapped apart, you can solder pin headers onto the USB programmer and use it exactly like the [Sparkfun FTDI Basic Breakout Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873).
